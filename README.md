# Forecasting System - Project Demand of Products at a Retail Outlet Based on Historical Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a demand forecasting system for a retail outlet using time series analysis on historical sales data. The system predicts future demand for various product categories (furniture, technology, and office supplies) to help the store optimize its inventory management and sales strategy. The models used include ARIMA, SARIMA, and Facebook Prophet.

## Features
- Time series forecasting for multiple product categories.
- Accurate prediction of sales trends with seasonal adjustments.
- Comparison of different forecasting models (SARIMA vs. Prophet).
- Data visualizations including sales trends and forecasted values.
- Actionable insights for inventory and business strategy optimization.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Pandas` for data handling and manipulation.
  - `Numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `Statsmodels`, `pmdarima` for ARIMA/SARIMA modeling.
  - `Facebook Prophet` for advanced time series forecasting.
